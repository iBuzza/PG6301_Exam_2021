# PG6301_Exam_2021

### Introduction
This is my hand-in for the PG6301 Exam. The base idea for the application is for users
to be able to log in with a username and chat with other people who are also connected to 
the same client. This application us built with NodeJS and an Express server. Users can also 
register new users to the application.

### Functionality
 **Implemented:
